## About

So... recently a couple of friends and I discovered several Discord bots that would allow you to create memes based on pre-defined templates. Sadly... most of them were strictly rate limited and didn't support too many templates at all... So... I thought... why not make my own? ^^

## Setup

Simply cloning this repository and executing ...

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

... should do the trick. Now, simply run `bot.py` and... you should be fine! 

_That is, assuming you have already created a bot using the Discord developer interface, retrieved its token and stored it in the environment variable `GAG_TKN`. (You can of course use the `.env` file for that)_

## Contact

For questions and/or feature requests you can simply create an issue and I'll do my best to fulfill all your wishes ^^.
